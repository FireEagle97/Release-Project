# Read Text Button Feature
Author: Anastasia Bondarenko

I created a read text button using SayButton component imported from say-react library in apartment information display to read all the text in post description. Integrating a SayButton enables users with visual impairments to access the content more conveniently by listening to the description of the apartment by clicking a button. Also, users that prefer auditory learning or multitasking can benefit from the addition of a SayButton: instead of having to read through the entire description, they can listen to it while performing other tasks, thus improving the overall user experience and engagement with the platform.

The button is a blue 'Read Text' button in the bottom-left of the apartment description.
